BoardgameListingWebApp
Description
Board Game Database Full-Stack Web Application. This web application displays lists of board games and their reviews. While anyone can view the board game lists and reviews, they are required to log in to add/ edit the board games and their reviews. The 'users' have the authority to add board games to the list and add reviews, and the 'managers' have the authority to edit/ delete the reviews on top of the authorities of users.

Features
Full-Stack Application
UI components created with Thymeleaf and styled with Twitter Bootstrap
Authentication and authorization using Spring Security
Authentication by allowing the users to authenticate with a username and password
Authorization by granting different permissions based on the roles (non-members, users, and managers)
Different roles (non-members, users, and managers) with varying levels of permissions
Non-members only can see the boardgame lists and reviews
Users can add board games and write reviews
Managers can edit and delete the reviews
Deployed the application on AWS EC2
JUnit test framework for unit testing
Spring MVC best practices to segregate views, controllers, and database packages
JDBC for database connectivity and interaction
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing data in the database
Schema.sql file to customize the schema and input initial data
Thymeleaf Fragments to reduce redundancy of repeating HTML elements (head, footer, navigation)
How to Run
Clone the repository
Open the project in your IDE of choice
Run the application
To use initial user data, use the following credentials.
username: bugs | password: bunny (user role)
username: daffy | password: duck (manager role)
You can also sign-up as a new user and customize your role to play with the application! ðŸ˜Š

Here's a breakdown of these technologies classified from front-end to back-end:

Front-End Technologies
HTML5 - Markup language for structuring web content.
CSS - Stylesheet language for designing and styling web pages.
JavaScript - Scripting language for dynamic interactions in the browser.
Twitter Bootstrap - Front-end CSS framework for responsive and mobile-first design.
Thymeleaf - Java-based template engine used for rendering views in a web application.
Thymeleaf Fragments - Reusable components within Thymeleaf for modularizing HTML templates.
Middle Layer (Connecting Front-End and Back-End)
Spring MVC - Part of the Spring framework that manages the Model-View-Controller architecture to handle web requests and render views.
Spring Security - Provides authentication and authorization for securing web applications.

Back-End Technologies
Java - Programming language used to implement the business logic.
Spring Boot - Framework for building standalone, production-ready Spring applications with embedded servers.
JDBC - Java Database Connectivity, a Java API for connecting and executing SQL queries in databases.
H2 Database Engine (In-memory) - Lightweight, in-memory database often used for development and testing.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 - Provides scalable virtual servers in the cloud to host back-end services.

Testing and Build Tools
JUnit - Testing framework for unit testing Java code.
Maven - Build automation and dependency management tool primarily for Java projects.
This classification positions each technology based on its typical role in a full-stack Java web application.
