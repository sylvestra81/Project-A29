BoardgameListingWebApp

Description
Board Game Database Full-Stack Web Application. I'd like to present an overview of our web application that manages board games and their reviews. The application allows anyone to browse and view lists of board games along with their respective reviews. However, to add or modify content, user authentication is required.

                                                Users can log in to add new board games and submit reviews.
                                                Managers, in addition to the user privileges, have elevated permissions that allow them to edit or delete reviews.
                                                This access control ensures that the content remains organized while allowing appropriate users to contribute and manage reviews effectively.

Technologies

Front-End Technologies
HTML5 - Markup language for structuring web content.
CSS - Stylesheet language for designing and styling web pages.
JavaScript - Scripting language for dynamic interactions in the browser.
Twitter Bootstrap - Front-end CSS framework for responsive and mobile-first design.
Thymeleaf - Java-based template engine used for rendering views in a web application.
Thymeleaf Fragments - Reusable components within Thymeleaf for modularizing HTML templates.
Middle Layer (Connecting Front-End and Back-End)
Spring MVC - Part of the Spring framework that manages the Model-View-Controller architecture to handle web requests and render views.
Spring Security - Provides authentication and authorization for securing web applications.

Back-End Technologies
Java - Programming language used to implement the business logic.
Spring Boot - Framework for building standalone, production-ready Spring applications with embedded servers.
JDBC - Java Database Connectivity, a Java API for connecting and executing SQL queries in databases.
H2 Database Engine (In-memory) - Lightweight, in-memory database often used for development and testing.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 - Provides scalable virtual servers in the cloud to host back-end services.

Testing and Build Tools
JUnit - Testing framework for unit testing Java code.
Maven - Build automation and dependency management tool primarily for Java projects.
This classification positions each technology based on its typical role in a full-stack Java web application.
